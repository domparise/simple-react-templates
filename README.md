# simple-react-templates
the ultimate minimalist framework  
  
uses (react as a view engine)[https://github.com/magalhas/express-react-engine]  
  
all structural and functional front-end code exists as JSX in client/components  
  
modify client/index.js to connect arbitrary client-side javascript, and to bind to the client's React  
  
uses gruntfile to compile jsx into client/public/js and stylus into client/public/css
